# NYPD Misconduct Complaint Database â€“ 08.20.20

`ccrb_database_raw.xlsx` is a record of the complaints made by the public to the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB). These complaints span two distinct periods: the time since the CCRB started operating as an independent city agency outside the NYPD in 1994 and the prior period when the CCRB operated within the NYPD. The data includes 323,911 unique complaint records involving 81,550 active or former NYPD officers. The data does not include complaints for which the CCRB has not completed an investigation as of July 2020. For more information, please visit [nyclu.org/nypdrecords](https://nyclu.org/nypdrecords)
